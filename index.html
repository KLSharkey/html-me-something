            <h1>This is a story of a cat named Truman...</h1>
            <p>Truman, aka "Nurse Cat", was adopted from <a href="http://www.homewardpet.org/" > Homeward Pets</a> in 2014 shortly after my husband and I moved to Seattle.</p>
            <p>We knew from the start that Truman was special, but we didn't know how much so until we brought him home.</p>

            <h2>Nurse Cat</h2>
            <p>We decided to adopt an animal companion for me after moving here so that I would have some company at home while my husband was working.</p>
            <p>Due to my chronic illness, I was spending a lot of time at home, and since we had just moved and didn't know anyone in town, we thought a cat would be a great companion.</p>
            <p>Right off the bat, it was obvious that Truman could tell when I was having a flare up. </p>
            <p>He would lie with me in bed for hours and even put a paw on my forehead when I was running a fever.</p>
